            <h3>Platfom Lead - Public Cloud</h3>
            <h3>Datacom Cloud</h3>
            <p class="subDetails">Oct. 2019 - Present</p>
            <p>
              In my role, I focus on enhancing the VMWare, Windows, and Linux infrastructure that constitutes the Datacom Public Cloud for government. My top priority revolves around ensuring platform stability, while leveraging documentation and emphasizing automation as key tools.
              <p>
              I am accountable for designing architecture solutions for new projects, as well as implementing designs from other teams. Collaborating with subject matter experts, I contribute to the development of effective solutions and actively participate in architectural workshops. Additionally, I have served as both an approver and submitter in the architecture review board, presenting my own designs and providing valuable insights.
              <p>
                As the platform owner, I am the go-to source for expertise, guidance, and support for product teams, clients, and management alike. My role is instrumental in ensuring seamless communication and efficient problem-solving, fostering an environment of innovation and excellence.

            <h3>Technical Team Lead - Azure Stack</h3>
            <h3>Datacom Cloud</h3>
            <p class="subDetails">Jun. 2018 - Oct. 2019</p>
            <p>I successfully led a team in the delivery of a new platform within the Datacom Cloud portfolio. My responsibilities included managing and maintaining existing Microsoft Azure Stack deployments in New Zealand, serving as the project lead for deploying a new production stack in Australia, and meticulously documenting the system before the production nodes went live.

              <p>One notable accomplishment during this role was automating approximately 80% of the daily/weekly maintenance tasks, which significantly reduced costs associated with the growing platform. Despite the geographical spread of my team members between Australia and New Zealand and their primary roles on VMWare platforms, we effectively managed our time to ensure optimal results on both fronts.
              
              <p>As the administration and management of the Azure Stack heavily relied on PowerShell, I rapidly familiarized myself with the language and navigated the learning curve proficiently.

            This site is the my attempt at the Cloud Resume Challenge project! The main goal was to create an online resume while showcasing the skills I learned on Amazon Web Services. I used a mix of technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, AWS S3 buckets, Pipelines, Dynamo DB, Lambda, and APIs, among others.
