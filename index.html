            <h3>Platfom Lead - Public Cloud</h3>
            <h3>Datacom Cloud</h3>
            <p class="subDetails">Oct. 2019 - Present</p>
            <p>
              My focus is on the continuous improvement of the VMWare, Windows and Linux infrastructure that makes up the Datacom Public Cloud for governement. 
              Stability of the platform is my first priority, documentation and an automation focus are my biggest tools. </p>
            <p>  
              I am resonsible for creating architechture designs for new solutions as well as implementing designs from other teams, worked with other subject matter experts to develop solutions and participated in architectural workshops.
              I have participated in the architechture review board as both an approver and as a submitter with my own designs.</p>
            <p>  
              As the platform owner, I provide authority, advice and guidence across product teams, customers, and management. 
              My biggest achievement/improvement to the platform to date is implementing a new credential management system and automating ESXi host root password rotations to unique passwords for over 800+ hosts, all with zero human touch.

            <h3>Technical Team Lead - Azure Stack</h3>
            <h3>Datacom Cloud</h3>
            <p class="subDetails">Jun. 2018 - Oct. 2019</p>
            <p>Managed a team of four to deliver a new platform in the Datacom Cloud family.
              I was resonsible for managing and maintaining the existing Microsoft Azure Stack early adopter deployments in NZ, act as project lead for new production stack deployment in Australia, and documnent the system from the ground up piror to production nodes going live.</p>
            <p>  
              My biggest achievement in this role was automating 80% of the daily/weekly maintenance tasks which were a huge cost sink for the fledgling platform. 
              My team members were spread between AU and NZ and worked as a 50% FTE, jugling their time with their primary roles on the VMWare platforms and my Azure Stack. <br>
              Administration and management of the Azure stack is predominantly done via Powershell and was a bit of a learning curve for me, I found that I picked it up very quickly
